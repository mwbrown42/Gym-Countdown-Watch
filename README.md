This is a quick and dirty project to make a 60 second timer armband.  It uses an ESP32 DOIT module, a .96" OLED display and a 3D printed holder that is all strapped to your arm with velcro.

Non-affilliate links to the needed parts:

The software is in the zip file.  It can be loaded into PlatformIO and then flashed into the DOIT board via the USB connector.  You will have to adjust the settings in platformio.ini to match your hardware serial port setup.

I have included both the Fusion360 file and the corresponding STL file of the arm holder for adjustment of the design and 3D printing.

Here are my two videos on the project:
